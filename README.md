# Combine ALMA, ACA, and TP observations
### Introduction
This repository documents my workflow and scripts for combining ALMA single-dish and interferometric observations.
The main processing follows the [ALMICA](https://github.com/baobabyoo/almica). 

### Data
Two datasets are used. You can download them from the ALMA Science Archive by entering the project ID:
- SgrA : `2015.1.00149.S`   
- CB68 : `2022.1.00131.S`   

### Requirement
- CASA (mainly for exporting MS)   
- Miriad (mainly for combination)   
- CARTA (for image visualization)
